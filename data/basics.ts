The game relies on the integrity of the individual to show consideration for other players and to abide by the rules. This emphasis on personal honor reflects a core value of honesty. 2. Tradition: Many aspects of golf are steeped in tradition, such as the customary golf attire, the silence before a golfer swings, and the shaking of hands after a round. This connects players to the long history of the game and can instill a sense of pride and belonging. 3. Persistence and Patience: Golf is a challenging game that requires a great deal of practice to master. It teaches players the value of persistence in improving their skills and patience in dealing with the ups and downs that are inherent in the game. 4. Sportsmanship: Golf is a competitive sport, but it is also one where sportsmanship is highly valued. Acknowledging good shots of your opponents and accepting bad luck or a bad play without outward frustration are important parts of the game. This promotes values of fairness and equanimity. These elements and more come together to create a sport that is not just about hitting a small ball into a hole, but also about personal growth, respect for others, and connection to a centuries-old tradition.',

The rough often lines both sides of the fairway and is designed to penalize golfers who do not hit their balls within the designated fairway. The thicker and longer grass can hinder the golfer's swing and make it harder to control the ball's direction and speed, making it more challenging to reach the green successfully from the rough than from the fairway. Some courses may also have different levels of rough (first cut, second cut, etc.), with the grass getting progressively longer the further you get from the fairway.

    caption:
      "Wedges are a type of club, similar to irons, but designed for short-distance, high-accuracy shots, often to get the ball onto the green or out of a hazard. The name 'wedge' comes from the shape of the clubhead, which is broad and angled like a wedge. Wedges typically have higher lofts, shorter shafts, and heavier clubheads than other irons. The high loft of the wedge means that the ball is hit with a steeper trajectory, which is useful for getting over obstacles or stopping the ball quickly on the green. There are several types of wedges, each with slightly different characteristics: Pitching Wedge (PW): This is the most common type of wedge, usually with a loft between 44 and 48 degrees. It's often used for shots into the green from a distance of 110-130 yards. Gap Wedge (GW): The gap wedge has a loft between a pitching wedge and a sand wedge, typically between 50 and 54 degrees. It's used for intermediate distance shots, to 'fill the gap' between the pitching and sand wedge. Sand Wedge (SW): Designed specifically for bunker shots, the sand wedge has a loft of around 54-58 degrees. The bottom of the club (the 'sole') is wider, allowing it to 'bounce' through the sand rather than digging in. Lob Wedge (LW): This club has the highest loft, usually between 58 and 64 degrees. It's used for high, short shots, when the ball needs to get up quickly and stop quickly. The correct choice of wedge depends on the distance to the hole, the lie of the ball, and the conditions of the course. Skilled golfers often carry several different wedges in their bag to handle a variety of situations on the course.",

The handicap system allows golfers to subtract strokes from their gross score, effectively reducing their score in relation to par. For example, a golfer with a handicap of 15 gets to deduct 15 strokes from their total score at the end of the round. As of 2020, the World Handicap System (WHS) is used to calculate handicaps globally. This system is based on the average of the best eight scores from a golfer's last 20 rounds, adjusted for the difficulty of the courses played. In professional golf, no handicaps are used.",

    caption: `An "unplayable lie" is a situation where the ball has come to rest in a position where the player believes they cannot or should not attempt to play their next stroke. This might be because the ball is stuck in a bush, deep in thick rough, up against a tree, in a hole, etc. Under the rules of golf, a player is the sole judge of whether their ball is unplayable. They can declare their ball unplayable anywhere on the course, except when the ball is in a water hazard. If a player declares their ball unplayable, they incur a one-stroke penalty and then have three options for where to play their next stroke: 1. Stroke and Distance: The player can play a ball as nearly as possible at the spot from which the original ball was last played (i.e., they're essentially replaying their previous shot). 2. Back-On-the-Line Relief: The player can drop a ball behind the point where the ball lay, keeping that point directly between the hole and the spot on which the ball is dropped, with no limit to how far back the ball may be dropped. 3. Lateral Relief: The player can drop a ball within two club-lengths of the spot where the ball lay, but not nearer the hole. This rule gives golfers an out in particularly tough situations, but at the cost of adding a stroke to their score, so it's used as a last resort.`,

    caption:
      '"Out of bounds" is territory where play is not allowed. These areas are typically defined by the golf course and marked with white stakes or lines. Sometimes, a fence or wall can also serve as an out of bounds marker. you must take a one-stroke penalty and replay the shot from its original position or drop the ball from where it crossed the line. The player must take a stroke-and-distance penalty, which means the player adds one penalty stroke to their score, and then must hit another ball from the same spot as the original shot. The player may not play a ball from the out of bounds area. It is critical to avoid out of bounds!',

    caption:
      'A water hazard is any sea, lake, pond, river, ditch, surface drainage ditch or other open water course (whether or not containing water) and anything of a similar nature on the course. Water hazards are typically marked with yellow stakes or lines. As of the rule changes in 2019 by the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the R&A, the term "Water Hazards" has been replaced with "Penalty Areas" to include areas of water and other types of terrain. If your ball enters a water hazard / penalty area, you will have options on what to do next. You may either play the ball as it lies (if you can!), or drop the ball where the ball last crossed the edge of the penalty area, which will incur a penalty stroke, or you may return to the original spot of your previous spot and drop from there, again incurring a penalty stroke.',
