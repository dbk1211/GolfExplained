      'Since 1934, the Masters Tournament has been home to some of the greatest moments in golf. Amidst blooming azaleas, towering pines and flowering dogwoods, ' +
      'the first full week of April ushers in a stage unique to golf and to sport. Over four days and 72 holes, the smallest field in major championship golf competes for ' +
      'a chance to capture the Green Jacket and a place in Masters history. Take a journey down Magnolia Lane or stroll through Amen Corner, and explore the iconic traditions, ' +
      'moments and history of Masters Tournament like never before—past and present. Augusta National Golf Club was founded by Bobby Jones, the legendary amateur champion, and ' +
      'Clifford Roberts, an astute investment banker in New York.  Upon his retirement from championship golf in 1930, Bobby Jones had hoped to realize his dream of building a golf ' +
      'course. Following a brief conversation with Clifford Roberts, with whom Jones had met several times during the mid-1920s, it was decided the Club would be built near Augusta, ' +
      'Georgia, provided a suitable piece of ground was available. Thomas Barrett, Jr., a mutual friend of Jones and Roberts, was consulted and recommended a 365-acre property called ' +
      'Fruitland Nurseries. An option was taken on the property for $70,000. It was decided to establish a national membership for the Club, and Jones proposed Augusta National would ' +
      'be an appropriate name. Construction on the new course began in the first half of 1931 and the course opened in December 1932 with a limited amount of member play. Formal ' +
      'opening took place in January 1933. Looking to provide a service to golf by hosting a tournament, Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts decided to hold an annual event beginning ' +
      'in 1934. The final decision was made at a meeting in New York at the office of Club member W. Alton Jones. Roberts proposed the event be called the Masters Tournament, but ' +
      'Bobby Jones objected thinking it too presumptuous. The name Augusta National Invitation Tournament was adopted and the title was used for five years until 1939, when Jones ' +
      'relented and the name was officially changed. The first Tournament was held March 22, 1934, and beginning in 1940, the Masters was scheduled each year during the first full week in April.',

      'The PLAYERS Championship (commonly known as simply The PLAYERS) is an annual golf tournament on the PGA Tour. Originally known as ' +

      'in 2022). The field usually includes the top 50 players in the world rankings, but unlike the major championships and World Golf Championships events, it is owned by the PGA Tour and not an  ' +
      'official event on other tours. Despite not being a major, it has been promoted as such by the tour, dubbed the fifth major, and is often regarded as the next most prestigious tournament in ' +
      'golf. This is because of the characteristics it shares with the majors, such as the high class field and its large purse. It also has a renowned host course in Ponte Vedra Beach, ' +
      'Florida (the TPC at Sawgrass Stadium Course at which the tournament has been played since 1982, home of the iconic par-3 No. 17 "Island Green").',
