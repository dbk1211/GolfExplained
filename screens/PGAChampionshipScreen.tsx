            The PGA Championship, first played in 1916, is the youngest of the
            four majors and the second major championship in golfâ€™s annual
            rotation each May. Originally a match play event, it changed to
            stroke play in 1958. Perennially featuring the strongest field in
            the men's game based on the Official World Golf Rankings, it is
            known for dramatic finishes and notable champions, with the
            Wanamaker Trophy inscribed with names such as Walter Hagen, Ben
            Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Brooks Koepka, and Rory McIlroy.

            The PGA Championship is a bit different from the other majors in
            terms of its field. It tends to have more club professionals in its
            ranks, as 20 spots in the tournament are reserved for club
            professionals who perform well in the PGA Professional National
            Championship.

            In the world of golf, the term "club professional" generally refers
            to a professional golfer who works at a specific golf course or
            club, typically in a role that involves both playing and teaching
            the game, as well as managing golf operations. Their duties often
            include giving lessons to members, organizing tournaments and
            events, managing the pro shop, and promoting golf at the grassroots
            level. Some club professionals may also play competitively in
            regional tournaments or in events organized by the PGA of America.

            In general, the level of playing skill among touring professionals
            is higher than among club professionals. Touring professionals are
            essentially the top tier of golfers in the world. However, many club
            professionals are also highly skilled players. In fact, the PGA of
            America, which represents club professionals in the United States,
            reserves spots in the field of the PGA Championship for the top 20
            finishers in the PGA Professional National Championship, effectively
            giving the best club professionals a chance to compete against the
            top touring professionals in a major championship.
